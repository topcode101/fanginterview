Hints: metrics; diagnosis; framework 

`why fail`: random segmentation analysis and do not sounds like you have real experience. You communication matters a lot here.

**Solution:**

As always, think about the goal: why do this ? Clearly this is to answer the business question that if anything specific happens. Let’s follow a framework here: metric definition clarification, external attribution, internal attribution. 

`Tip` The key to this question is a organized answer! There is no right or wrong! It is about your communication. You goal is a reall do the investigation and find the root cause. 

Now, the definition: 

> Before we deepdive into what’s going on, let’s clarify the definition of the metric here. What do you mean numbers of search, as of how do you define a search here? Then when you say increasing 10%, what is the benchmark.

Then the interviewer would say: 1. the search is defined as if a user hit the search button. 2. the benchmark is actually from past month.

`I would always suggest come up with a formula to investigate. It is the breakdown! There are two ways: Breakdown by the funnel; and breakdown by different segmentations! For example`

Search  = active users * search rate  = sum { (user segmentations * search rate)}

This will make your answer crystial clear!!

Now here is the framework.

> `A senior level answer` **First of all, find hypothesis!! Always try to communicate with other teams! That is more important than you just do it by your own**

If you are in the company, you won’t do the work directly. Talk to different stakeholders to get their opinion that if this trend is normal! even collect feedbacks on the hypothesis! If you are junior level, you would just head down do the work which is less efficiency!

— The rest would need to pay: 

> Then let’s understand the situation here:  Have some basic sense. If this is a sharp change? or a  change that happened slowly ? It is important for me to sense it and have some initial guess. For example, if is sharp change, it is likely related to some event: internal product launch or extenal events. If it is a slow change, it would be more like seasonality or market interest change.

> `senior level`Finally you can report and give recommendations. Give suggestions on if we can do or fix anything. If it is about any broken things, you must do `estimation of the impact` to know the priority of the task to do ! Bring that up to stakeholders to explain the ergency
