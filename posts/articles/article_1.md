**Hint** Very hot question. Use business sense to guess why this happens the then use data to prove it. Causal analysis is needed to avoid correlation and causation dilemma.

**Solution:** 
First of all, always ask why we need to do this? In here it is why we want to understand this question. Clarify with the interviewer

>  To clarify the goal, it looks like FB is having this problem that may harm engagement, so we want to first quantify this problem and then we can try to think about solutions right? 

Then, how to measure. You can think out loud: 

> The common measurement is just A/B test or observational data. Now before we do A/B test, which cost more and harder to do , we can try to see the if we can address the probem with observational data analysis

OK, so what you do?If you answer :

> `bad answer` Check the activity of users by two cohort: users with parents or not. To see if there are correlations: users with parents are of lower activity 

**Well you are making a mistake!**

The rest need to pay

The above point out the problem. THis is a very typical causal analysis. You donâ€™t need to be an expert on casual analysis, but you need to know the drawbacks and potential solutions and methodologies! [ link to causal analysis in tech companies ]
Remember, you are try to discuss with someone for a data solution! You have to provide all pros and cons for different methodolegies. Some are more accurate some are not. Depends on the goal, you will choose the right solution.

THe final question is about how to address it. This involves with business sense. This is both data and hypothesis driven! It means, you know that parent is a reason that reduce the engagement, but how do you give recommendations and suggestions? Based on data?
