* Business Area: {Engagement}
### Real Interview Question
(with some adjustment)

* We found some users have lower engagement, how to improve?

### Pro Tips

This is truly an open question. What we want to show to interviewer is
* Your ability to use data as a tool to improve products!

A junior answer would not be structured.
Try to make it sounds like a methodology to find out opportunities from data
and make recommendation & prove it.

Note: this is a very typical analytical question, not technical question.
Do not focus on use model to find most important features.

###  A recommended answer

* Start from clarify what is our goal here.
> To clarify, I would treat this question as to make data driven inferences and decisions to improve engagement for some users, right?
> I also want to clarity **what is the engagement here**. As you know, tictok has supply and demand side, the engagment could be very different for them.

* Then you can briefly talk about your 'methodology' to tackle this problem.
* Remember data is a tool to address the problem.

>
> I think on high level, to address or answer this question, I need to answer
>
> 1. Who are those users with low engagement?
> 2. Why are those users with low engagement?
> 3. How do we improve their engagement?
>
> And I would use data as a tool to answer these questions.
> Does it sounds reasonable?

* you can pause here to ask interviewer for feedbacks.

> For first question, who are the low engagement users: we should be able to know for sure as they are existing users.
> We should be able to easily describe them with internal data collected.
> Things I would focus on
> 1. `Tenure of users`. It is likely new or old users are of different type
> 2. `demographic` of users. We do want to know how to describe them
> 3. Timeline of the engagement metrics of these users. This is very important to understand if they are ever or always less engaged.
> 4. Product usages. like do they share video, do they create video, etc.
> Understand our customers and build this data profiles can help us know more.
>
> For the second question, on find out why. There is typically two ways:
> 1. qualitative
> 2. quantatative
>
> Qualitative is relatively straight forward: if the engagement metric is a lot lower than we expected, I would actually recommend to do user research!
> Ask user directly on why they like or not like and what could we do to improve.
* Note: then you would want to talk about the pros/cons of different method.
> However, qualitative method could be very biased due to user self-selection on questions.

> Now, let's see how we can do it quantatatively. The most effective way is actually user jorney or funnel analysis.
> The idea is this: we benchmark user journey with two groups: one with less engagement, one with higher engagment.
> We then build the funnel metrics step by step.
> Once we observe the funnel with the lowest conversion, we can make hypothesis from there.
> Common hypotheses are
> 1. lack of awareness - the entry points are not really clear
> 2. lack of understanding of the process: for example, the content or design is very not attractive.

* Now, ask your interviewer if this is the right path.

> Does this sound like a good plan ? (confirm this plan with interviewer)

* What's next would be a problem solving: that giving a hypothesis, would you be able to prove it?
* Let's say the hypothesis is that the recommended video is not good enough. So we improved the recommendation.
* What we will do next?

> After we have the hypothesis, we can use A/B test to prove it.

* I'll ignore the details on A/B test here.
