httpHints: define business problem ; define metric ; 

**`A Common Failed Reason`**: I guess you don’t know where to start even and feel a bit panic in the interview. Don’t focus too much on technicals or a perfect metrics. This quesiton is more on business discussions and the communication strategy. This is a quetion that is kind of reshaping an OKR of a company. Remember to translating a business problem into data problem.

First of all, this is a blurred question. The ambiguity is intended and is actually meant for more senior people to answer in real working situation. If a CEO comes to you and ask the question, what would you response?

Lucily this  is an interview question so you can ask what ever you want to `discuss` the direction of the answer. Different interviewer may have a bit different answer to this but in the end, it is about to demonstrate your thought process that tacking such high level quesitions.

As a rule of thumb, there is a trick for you to get start, in stead of asking about the goal, ask why. `Why even start this question or start this task`. Here is an exampe answer to get the conversation started.

> This sounds a very broad but also quite interesting topic. You are asking about ‘meaningful social interactions’. Before we talk about the some candidates, I think it is crucial to understand a bit more on the background and the proble we are addressing here.
>
> So, may I ask why we are redefining the metric and what are the concerns? 

With this starter, interviewers now understand you are discussing the business problem. 
`Do not start by giving a answer like ‘weighted combination of DAU and …’. `

Even if you ask about the background, the interviewers may want you to take a guess. To be honest it is a little bit hard for a person without any context but, on the other hand, if you are a senior or staff level data scientist, you’d better to have a bit business acumen to take the guess here:

> Here is my understanding: Generally speaking we’d like to transfer from ‘relevant’ to ‘meaningful’, which matches our altimate goal of FB: that is to connect people together. One example is that there are too many news feed on FB these days that are about business, brand and media, which in turns takes the place of the post from our friends, etc.

So, until now, you get the sense of the busines problem itself. What’s next?
Interviewer: now can you define a better metric to measure meaningful? 

Consider the following dimention

* Long and short term measurement
* Trade-offs of different target

Also remember, make your answer structured!
I am going to structure the answer in the following three paragraph

1. How to define meaningful?
2. How to quantify a meaningful?
3. How to think about some pros & cons of different definition.

Bring up your own answer about meaningful definition, no need to be perfect!

> Here is my thought: I’ll bring up my proposal with different stakeholder of course for discussions and feedback. 
> So, let’s say: meaningful interactions means: `interaction posted by indivisual users that is more related to personal emotions and also have a positive way to connect people together! `

There is no right or wrong, no need to be perfect! `It is about if you can quantify a business question in to measuable data problem to solve!`

Now, define the metrics. Here is an example answer.

> We should collect the meaningful actions from each product team. It will be more objective but is totally fine. We can also even start a survey ask people what kind of interaction is more meaningful to them.
>
> I’ll list a few for now:
>
> For news feed, this would be `number of reactions(likes, reply, msg) for a user that is related to his friends or families.
> `. For messagers, this could be `number of messages that are send to users` 
>
> On the opposite, `number of post that triggers engagement-bait` is a completely opposite metric! Those posts should be demoted.
> or 
> `interactions of post that is related to seaking help like missing childern` should be a metric to measure tsome sort of social impact and shoud be generally promoted.

Finally, talk about the how to pick these metrics candidate.

> First of all, from metrics pespective, we should rule out metrics that are hard to measure or taking actions. Metrics are used to set up goals and it should be clear.
>
> From busienss perspective, the final metrics will be different from product to product. We should have an final overview that these metrics between different teams are aligned and no conflict. A promotion of one metric is likely conflicted to another metric.
>
> We should also pay attention to long & short term goals as well. (I’ll skip these part as it is more of a free discussion here.) 

Most importantly how do we measure the successful of a definition?

> Experimentation! Set up a long term hold out group for any product changes that is related to the metric change.
> For example, we might change algorithm target functions because we adjusted the weight of different engagement metrics to make it more ‘meaningful’. A/B test would be the golden standard to test both short term and long term impact.

What do you think about machine learning models here?

>It will have impact on the labeling on supervised machining models or target functions of any optimization algorithms like news feeding rankings.



With all the these above, you passed the interview.
